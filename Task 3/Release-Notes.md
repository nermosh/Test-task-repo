# Release Note

[Plans](Plans.md) offer product clients a variety of service options defined within a preconfigured scope.

> Note: Shortly after the feature implementation, your customer service flow and solutions may require adjustments due to an extensive system update. 
> Specifically, user records now include additional properties, which are detailed in the latest version of our API reference. 
> For example, users can be placed in an ['idle' state](Users.md#idle) before confirming the purchase of a plan.

The number of plans per provider is **unlimited**, so feel free to create and customize them as needed.
However, plans do not add new functionality, as they simply show basic user attributes. They fully follow the [user state flow](Users.md#user-service-states).
